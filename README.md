# 🌱 Crop Prediction Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **machine learning–based crop prediction model** designed to assist farmers, researchers, and agricultural planners in identifying the most suitable crop to cultivate based on given environmental and soil parameters. By leveraging data-driven techniques, the model helps improve decision-making in agriculture, optimize resource use, and increase crop yield.

## 🔍 Features
- Predicts the most suitable crop for cultivation based on input conditions.  
- Utilizes supervised machine learning algorithms for classification.  
- Preprocessing of soil and climate datasets for improved accuracy.  
- Jupyter Notebook implementation for easy reproducibility and experimentation.  
- Scalable to integrate with web or mobile applications for real-world usage.

## 📊 Dataset
The model is trained on an agricultural dataset containing parameters such as:  
- **N (Nitrogen), P (Phosphorus), K (Potassium)** values in soil  
- **Temperature**  
- **Humidity**  
- **pH value of soil**  
- **Rainfall**  

**Target variable**: Crop label (best-suited crop).
